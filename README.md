# OSAutoBalance
OldSwedes AutoBalance

Plugin that will switch second-best player from the winning team with the last player in the losing team to balance the teams out. 

The first idea was to make the best player swap with the last player in the other team but that will leave the best and worst player jumping back and forth which wouldnt solve much, i.e first team wins 3 rounds, the losing team gets the best player and wins the next 3 rounds which doesnt resolve much. If we rather swap the second-best player with the last player we can with time have a stronger team thinned out and make the teams even even if one of the teams has an alot better player than the other team.

The default is to make a balance assessment every time a team has made a 3 round winning streak.
If the winning team players frags sum exceedes 1.8 times the other team, then a balance will be done, i.e the second-best player in the winning team will swap with the last player in the losing team.

Because the plugin will assess the team skill using number of kills with the 1.8 ratio we will get more swaps in the beginning of the map than in the end of the map because kill count will even out with time and the fairly good players will swap teams in the first few rounds.

The plugin also knows about halftimes so it will keep track of the scores and streaks correctly after halftime.
